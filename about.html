            <p>Hello, my name is (name), and I am currently in a (course) program. And my age is 21. I focused my programming skills on Java and C++, honing my expertise in these languages. In terms of web development, I have gained practical experience in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My passion for web development led me to complete a 20-day OJT (on-the-job training) as a web developer, where I am still learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout the OJT, I extensively utilized PHP as the primary backend language, accompanied by MySQL for effective database management. Moreover, I was fortunate to be involved in quality assurance practices, including data gathering, creating comprehensive flowcharts, and developing meticulous test cases. Continually expanding my knowledge in these domains is a top priority for me.</p>
