            <p>Hello, I am still Student enrolled in a BSIT program. At 21 years old, I am learning programming. Like web development using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Recently, I had the opportunity to dive deeper into web development during a 20-day on-the-job training (OJT). I'm still in the early stages of learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Throughout the OJT, I primarily used PHP as the main backend language and worked with MySQL for managing databases. It was a great experience because I also got to explore quality assurance (Q.A.) activities, such as gathering data, creating flowcharts, and developing test cases. Expanding my knowledge and skills in these areas is a top priority for me. I'm excited to continue my learning journey!</p>
